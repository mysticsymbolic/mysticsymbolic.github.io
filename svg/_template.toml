# This can be used as a template for an SVG symbol's metadata.
# Just be sure you rename it to have the same name as the SVG, only
# with a a ".toml" extension instead of an ".svg" extension.
#
# So for example, if you want to define metadata for "antler.svg",
# you can make a copy of this file and call it "antler.toml".
#
# Also note that any lines that begin with a "#" are comments,
# so they will be ignored by the code.
#
# Note also that all properties that are booleans
# (i.e., true or false) will, unless otherwise noted,
# always default to false if left undefined.

# If true, this indicates that the symbol should always have
# a symbol nested within its nesting area(s).
