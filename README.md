This is an attempt by [Nina Paley][] (art) and [Atul Varma][] (code) to tinker
with procedural art.

Right now there is no particular goal other than to explore various ideas.
The project consists of a web site with multiple pages, each of which is
and experiment of some kind.

It can be [viewed online][] or iterated on locally using the instructions below.

## Quick start

This requires [NodeJS][].  It was started with
NodeJS 14.15.4, but hopefully it should work with
any recent version.

After cloning the repository and entering it, run:

```
npm run watch
```

then visit http://localhost:1234.

## Running tests

To run tests interactively, run:

```
npm run test:watch
```

## Deployment

To deploy the project to GitHub Pages, run:

```
npm run deploy
```
